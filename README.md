# Exercise_SalesCommission

Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who grosses $5000 in sales in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650. Write an application (using an array of counters) that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges (assume that each salespersonâ€™s salary is truncated to an integer amount): $200-299 | $300-399 | $400-499 | $500-599 | $600-699 | $700-799 | $800-899 | $900-999 | $1000 and over.
